As a literary expert with deep knowledge of book analysis, your task is to create a comprehensive, unique summary for "${bookInfo.title}" by ${bookInfo.author}.

I need a detailed JSON output with the following structure:
{
  "title": "${bookInfo.title}",
  "subtitle": "A compelling and relevant subtitle that captures the essence of the book",
  "author": "${bookInfo.author}",
  "rating": "A realistic rating out of 5 (e.g., '4.34')",

  "publication_year": "The year this book was published",
  "abstract": "A 150-200 word compelling overview of the book that captures its main thesis, approach, and value proposition. This should be written in a professional, publisher-quality style.",

  "author_description": "A 3-4 sentence biography of the author, highlighting their credentials, background, and notable achievements relevant to the book's subject matter.",
  "source_list": "Best Self Help Books",
  "index": ${bookInfo.index || 0},
  "is_self_help": ${bookInfo.genres?.includes("Self Help") || false},
  "chapters": [
    {
      "chapter_number": 1,
      "title": "Chapter 1 Title - Capturing Key Concept",
      "summary": "A 120-150 word detailed summary of this chapter's core concepts. This should feel like a professional book summary, with specific insights, examples, and takeaways from this section of the book. Write in a tone that matches the book's style.\n\nThe second paragraph should expand on these ideas with additional context or examples, ensuring readers understand the practical applications or theoretical foundations presented in this chapter."
    },
    {
      "chapter_number": 2, 
      "title": "Chapter 2 Title - Next Major Concept",
      "summary": "A distinct summary for this chapter with its own style and approach. Avoid patterns or templated language from other chapters.

      "chapter_number": 3,
      "title": "Chapter 3 Title - Another Core Theme",
      "summary": "A summary written with different sentence structures and vocabulary than previous chapters. This text should have its own rhythm and tone while remaining faithful to the book's content and style.\n\nUse specific examples or frameworks from this section of the book, ensuring this does not follow the same pattern as other chapter summaries."

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Each chapter summary MUST be unique in tone, sentence structure, and phrasing. Avoid repetitive patterns or templated language across chapters.
2. Total content should be approximately 600 words across all chapter summaries.
3. Chapter titles should reflect actual content from the book, not generic placeholders.
4. Match the writing style to the book's genre and author's voice.
5. Ensure accuracy of information - only include verifiable content from the book.
6. Create content that feels like it was written by a human literary expert, not AI-generated.
7. Use natural language with varied sentence structures, avoiding formulaic writing.
